# DS one Issue List

This document tracks outstanding tasks derived from the DS one specification and roadmap. Use it to coordinate work that has not
been captured in GitHub issues yet.

## Documentation

### Starlight documentation site

- [ ] Build a Starlight-powered documentation site that consolidates DS one guidance across installation, usage, and maintenance.
  - [ ] Surface all installation methods (npm, Bun, Yarn, CDN) with copyable snippets (_specification §Installation Methods_).
  - [ ] Explain the package/file structure so developers can locate components, units, pages, and supporting assets (_specification §File Structure_).
  - [ ] Provide development workflow coverage (dev server, tests, builds, publishing) so teams can follow the recommended lifecycle (_specification §Development Workflow_).
  - [ ] Document release checklists and troubleshooting guidance to keep the docs aligned with pre-publish requirements (_specification §§Pre-publish Checklist & Troubleshooting_).

Update the checklist above as milestones for the documentation site are completed.
